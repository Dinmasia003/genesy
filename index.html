  <ul>
    <li> Soccer. My favourite thing to do is watching football and I am an Arsenal Fan</li>
    <li> My second favourite thing would be listening to music. Music is a therapy</li>
    <li> I also love reading. i enjoy reading books both fictions and non fictions and my least favourite kind of book is <i>romance</i> </li>
    <li>Outdoor activities such as hicking, sight seeing, mountain climbing, gaming, etc also makes me happy but I hate over crowded spaces </li>
    <li>Meditation. My friends call it wierd but I call it peace. I love to sit all by my self doing nothing just huming or meditating or taking conscious and intentional breaths</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My current favorite website is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> becasuse I get to learn a lot from it as regarding my career in tech</p>
